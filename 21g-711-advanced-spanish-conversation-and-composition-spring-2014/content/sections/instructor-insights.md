_Below, Margarita Ribas Groeger describes various aspects of how she taught _21G.711 Advanced Spanish Conversation and Composition_._

### Pedagogy

Using a variety of current and thought provoking materials, such as journalistic texts and video reports, essays, films, and literary selections, the class addressed such questions as: How have new scientific and technological changes affected individuals, communities and relationships, value systems and beliefs, education, work, and the natural world? What are the promises and threats posed by new technologies? What are the existing attitudes towards technological innovation and scientific advances as expressed in the media, public debates, literature and art in Spanish-speaking societies? What are some of the ethical implications of technological decision-making?

Looking at Spanish-speaking societies through the ways they have been affected by science and technology offered an alternative thematic focus to the fifth or sixth semester Spanish language curriculum, one that was especially relevant and interesting to MIT students. At the same time, it offered students the opportunity to reflect on important issues in a wide range of fields, such as biotechnology, alternative energies, and digital technologies, that were also significant for their personal lives, their studies, or their future work.

The pedagogical methods employed in the class served to further the above-mentioned goals. Through activities which emphasized task-based communication, collaboration, role-playing and simulations, students were able to assume different roles, think critically about issues, develop arguments and engage with each other to solve a conflict, find a solution or come to an agreement, while expanding their cultural awareness and improving their communicative skills in Spanish.
